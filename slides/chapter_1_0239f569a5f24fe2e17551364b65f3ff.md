## So this is the one

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "babe26c6cf"
code_zoom: 92
hide_title: false
```

`@part1`
* `Vocab`: stores data shared across multiple documents
* To save memory, spaCy encodes all strings to **hash values**
* Strings are only stored once in the `StringStore`  via `nlp.vocab.strings`
* String store: **lookup table** in both directions

```python
coffee_hash = nlp.vocab.strings['coffee']
coffee_string = nlp.vocab.strings[coffee_hash]
```{{1}}

* Hashes can't be reversed â€“ that's why we  need to provide the shared vocab

```python
# Raises an error if we haven't seen the string before
string = nlp.vocab.strings[3197928453018144401]
```


`@script`
spaCy stores all shared data in a vocabulary, the Vocab.

This includes words, but also the labels schemes for tags and entities.

To save memory, all strings are encoded to hash IDs. If a word occurs more than once, we don't need to save it every time.

Instead, spaCy uses a hash function to generate an ID and stores the string only once in the string store. The string store is available as nlp dot vocab dot strings.

It's a lookup table that works in both directions. You can look up a string and get its hash, and look up a hash to get its string value. Internally, spaCy only communicates in hash IDs.

Hash IDs can't be reversed, though. If a word in not in the vocabulary, there's no way to get its string. That's why we always need to pass around the shared vocab.
